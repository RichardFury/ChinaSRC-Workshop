Who should attend user training?
We recommend that current and future users of Pawsey’s computational resources - 
particularly users of Setonix and Acacia - attend user training to most effectively and efficiently use Pawsey resources.

Are there pre-requisites to user training?
Some course have specific pre-requisites or skills to attend the training. Those pre-requisites will be noted. Additionally:

All course attendees: Require basic computer literacy, such as familiarity with the command line/Linux.
Advanced/Developer courses: Typically require experience programming in C/C++ or Fortran.
Can a training be tailored to my group?
Much Pawsey training is relevant across scientific domains. This is called 'generic' training.

However, some training is best tailored to the application within a specific domain. This is called 'bespoke' training.

To partner with Pawsey to create bespoke learning experiences for a large audience, please contact training@pawsey.org.au.
